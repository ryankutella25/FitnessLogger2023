FitnessLogger was my first big CS project. I was in CS classes all 4 years in highschool and senior year I decided to merge my passion for fitness with my passion for coding.
I used react native so this app could work on android and ios and used expo to make setup and production a little easier. 
Down the line when I was ready for storing workouts and sets, I used Amazon Firestore. I also used Firebase for authentification and email processes.
